### Business goals
A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Japanese. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

### Summary of prompt iterations
The meta.ai (free version, no login) started by not giving the kanji/hiragana texts in the vocabulary table. Prompt iteration for that specific prompt:
1. The vocabulary used in the sentence, in Japanese. If there are Kanji, also write the pronunciation in Hiragana. 
2. The vocabulary used in the sentence, in Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana. If there are Kanji, also write the pronunciation in Hiragana. 
3. The vocabulary used in the sentence, in Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana. If there are Kanji, also write the it Hiragana inside paranthesis, e.g. 日本語(にほんご) 
After 3, meta said "I don’t understand Japanese yet, but I’m working on it. I will send you a message when we can talk in Japanese.". 

This leads me to believe that the capabilities of the AI are limited, and I will move on to ChatGPT.
