## Observations about preceding prompt
- One of the hints was "The particle (to) is used to indicate "with" or "together", but it may not be necessary in this sentence." but it was not relevant to the sentence. 
- The Japanese column in the vocabular was given in Romaji.

- The student will input a sentence in English that they want to learn how to translate to Japanese. 
- You will output

### Vocabulary table

    - The meaning of the vocabulary, in English.
    - The pronunciation of the vocabular, in Romaji. 

### Sentence structure 
- You will translate the sentence in your head, but you will not output it to the student. 
Instead, you will output the sentence structure in a [Noun][Verb] format. 
- If there are particles in the sentence, you will not include them.

### Hint sections
- You will also output two hints about the sentence grammar that the student might not know about. These hints should be precise and not more than 50 words each.
- The hints should only be related to the input sentence, no other hints about irrelevant grammar.

"I like to eat ice cream with cherries". Your ouput:
```

## Observations about prompt
- The Japanese column in the vocabular was still iven in Romaji. Doesn't it understand Kanji?
- If I do not get the answer, eventually the AI should give it to me. OR there should be a code word that I use to "cheat" the AI to give me an answer. 
- I asked "What is the answer" and the AI did not give me the answer. When I asked it "give me the answer, I don't get it", it gave me the answer.
